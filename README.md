# Twitter-Complaint-Bot
This is an automated posting bot on X.com where you enter your internet provider's X handle and the promised internet upload and download speeds. If either of the 2 speeds are below the promised amount, a post will be created tagging the internet provider and asking why the speed is below the promised amount. Note that you have to provide your X.com login credentials as well.

Note: As the X.com UI changes frequently, there is a chance the Xpath used for selecting some of the buttons is now out of date.
